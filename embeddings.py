"""Embedding fetching for your semantic search system.

Two modes, controlled by the LAB3_EMBEDDING_MODE environment variable:

    "offline" (default) - a hashed bag-of-words vector. Fully implemented
                below already - you don't need to write or even fully
                understand this part, it's provided so you can build and
                test your whole pipeline with no API key and no network.
    "api"     - calls NVIDIA NIM's embeddings endpoint. THIS is the part
                you implement - see get_embedding() below.

Both modes return a plain Python list of floats, so the rest of your code
never needs to know which one is in use.
